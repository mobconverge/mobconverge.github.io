I have created a tutorial on how to write a cross platform iOS/Android app using the C++ and the Android NDK.  I've posted the source code on [github](https://github.com/markshiz/cross-platform-tutorial).  For anyone looking to get started, this is a great resource for playing around with the basic mechanics.
