## Mark Schisler, Principal

*Who am I?*

Hi. I'm Mark, an experienced Software Engineer and mentor working in the traditions of (XP) Extreme Programming.  My
areas of expertise are:

- Native development on iOS, Android, and Linux
- Web development in Elixir, Go, and Ruby on Rails
- Continuous Integration, Kanban, Lean Software Development, and Test Driven Development

*What do I like to do?*

I'm particularly interested in creating high quality software that helps make the world a better place. In that vein,
I once worked for a startup that was selected as a White House Champion of Change. TransLoc apps locate buses in real-
time and give students a safe ride home in places as disparate as Knoxville, TN and New York, NY.  

Before that I helped create a family of apps to control the Sensi Thermosat, which was ranked to have the 
highest consumer satisfaction in its category by J.D. Power and Associates.
